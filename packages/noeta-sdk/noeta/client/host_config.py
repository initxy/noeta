"""``HostConfig`` — the SDK's host-level (process) wiring surface (D3).

This splits the SDK's extension face in two:

* **Options** carries *agent identity + per-agent extension points* (Tool /
  Provider / Policy / Guard / Observer / Content Channel) — see
  :class:`~noeta.client.options.Options`.
* **HostConfig** carries *host-level wiring* that is NOT part of any agent
  identity and is decided once per process: the durable **storage** backend
  (EventLog / ContentStore / Dispatcher) and the host **runtime injections**
  (the HTML-app preview gateway, the live-MCP alias resolver). ``compile_options``
  never sees any of this, so two clients differing only in their HostConfig
  produce byte-identical AgentSpec identities.

Every field defaults to "absent", so ``HostConfig()`` reproduces today's
behaviour exactly: in-memory storage, no ``open_app`` tool, no live MCP. A
product backend (``noeta.agent.backend``) passes a populated HostConfig to opt
into durable storage / preview / MCP while still driving the engine only through
``noeta.sdk``.

    Storage triple
    --------------
    ``event_log`` / ``content_store`` / ``dispatcher`` inject an external,
    typically durable (sqlite) storage backend. Supply **all three or none**;
    omitting them (the default) makes the Client build its own in-memory triple,
    byte-identical to the historical single-session behaviour. The three are
    constructed together by the caller so the event log already holds the
    dispatcher as its ``lease_validator``.

    Runtime injections
    ------------------
    ``app_gateway`` is the live HTML-app preview gateway the ``open_app`` tool
    mounts against; ``None`` ⇒ no ``open_app`` tool (the prompt's tool list is
    unchanged). ``mcp_server_resolver`` resolves an enabled MCP alias to its full
    connectable spec each turn; ``None`` ⇒ no live MCP is connected.
    ``mcp_http_post`` is an injectable HTTP transport for the remote-MCP client
    (tests pass a fake; production leaves it ``None`` to use stdlib urllib).
    These are runtime objects, never part of the agent identity.

    ``workflow_allowed`` is the host kill-switch for the ``run_workflow`` control
    tool (off by default, matching the runtime default). ``write_mode`` is the
    process-level fs write policy (``"dry_run"`` stages a proposed diff without
    touching disk — the safe default; ``"apply"`` performs real writes); the
    Client maps it to the edit tools' ``FsWriteMode``.
