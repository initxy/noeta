# Changelog

All notable changes to Noeta are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). The 0.x history (packages
`noeta-runtime` and `noeta-sdk`) is in `CHANGELOG.md` at tag `v0.6.42`.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **An "always" shell approval no longer widens to the program and its first argument.**
  Approving `rm -rf build` used to let `rm -rf /` run unasked (and wrote that rule to a
  trusted project's `.noeta/shell-allowlist.json`). The remembered rule is now Claude Code's
  `Bash(...)` form, seeded as Claude Code seeds it (`git push *`, `ls *`), and the exact
  command for wrappers, destructive file programs and interpreters. The approval card (TUI)
  and the ACP option name the rule (`Always allow Bash(git push *)`), and no "always" choice
  is offered when nothing would be remembered. Approval details carry `always_label`.
- **An untrusted project no longer configures the agent.** `noeta` read `<cwd>/.noeta/agents`
  unconditionally, so a cloned repository could replace `main` with one in
  `bypassPermissions` running a command hook. A project's `.noeta/agents`, `.noeta/prompts`,
  `.noeta/skills` and `.agents/skills` now load only after `noeta trust`, like its
  `.noeta/plugins`; each one skipped is a notice. `Runtime.workspace_trusted` gates the
  workspace's prompt overrides (`None`, the default, trusts every workspace).
- **A sub-agent ends after its turn**, like Claude Code's, whatever its agent file says. An
  agent file without `one_shot: true` (every Claude Code agent file) used to leave its
  sub-agent waiting for input and its foreground parent waiting forever. The main agent
  stays conversational.
- **An image that the API would refuse no longer enters the history.** `Read` compared raw bytes
  with 5 MB, so a 4–5 MB image (over 5 MB once base64 encoded) failed every later request of
  the task. Images from `Read` and MCP results now go through `noeta.toolkit.images.fit_image`
  with Claude Code's limits: shrunk into 2000 x 2000 px and 3.75 MB raw with Pillow (the new
  `images` extra), else passed only when already within 5 MB of base64 and 8000 px a side, and
  refused with a reason otherwise. A scaled image's result says how coordinates map back.
  `Read`'s image file ceiling is now 128 MB (`IMAGE_MAX_BYTES`); `noeta.plugins.mcp.results`
  no longer exports `IMAGE_MAX_BYTES`.
- `make example` ran a build uv had cached; it now installs the example plugin editable.
- A second `registry.provider()` call for a family failed once that family's adapter module
  had been imported (the entry point named a package attribute the submodule rebound).

### Changed

- **Packages say what they hold** (old paths are gone, no aliases):
  `noeta.core.shell` / `tool_helpers` / `helpers` -> `noeta.toolkit.shell` / `tools` /
  `context` (code plugins share; the kernel never used it); `noeta.core.store.base` ->
  `noeta.core.store`; `noeta.core.store.sqlite` -> `noeta.backends.stores.sqlite`;
  `noeta.backends.postgres` -> `noeta.backends.stores.postgres`; `noeta.backends.execenv` ->
  `noeta.backends.execenvs`; `noeta.apps.local` / `remote` -> `noeta.host.*`,
  `noeta.apps.server` -> `noeta.host.http`, `noeta.apps.acp` -> `noeta.host.acp` (the ways in
  sit together); `noeta.apps` -> `noeta.cli` (the command is `noeta.cli.main`), with
  `from_settings` in `noeta.cli.config`; `noeta.presets` -> `noeta.agents` (agent files in
  `noeta/agents/files/`); `noeta.core.agent_files` -> `noeta.agents.agent_files`. `noeta`
  exports `LocalApp` and `RemoteClient`. The store contract tests ship as
  `noeta.testing.store_contract`. `scripts/lint-layout.py` (in `make check`) keeps code where
  CONTEXT.md's "Where code goes" puts it.
- **1.0 is a rewrite, one package `noeta`.** Tasks are append-only event logs with one writer
  (conditional appends, claims in the store), an inbox as the only way in, and one `Extension`
  interface for every capability. Includes the `noeta` command (terminal UI, `-p`, `acp`,
  `worker`, `serve`). Nothing from 0.x is compatible: APIs, stores and plugins.
- **Plugins are set from one table.** `config.toml` takes `[plugins.<name>]` (arguments,
  `enabled = false`) and `[agents.<name>] add_plugins`; `default_agents` takes `plugins=` and
  `add=` instead of one keyword per built-in plugin.
- **MCP servers from settings.** The terminal front ends start the `mcpServers` of
  `~/.noeta/settings.json` (Claude Code's format) and the `.mcp.json` servers it consents to.
- **Plugin slash commands** show in the TUI's `/help` and as the editor's commands over ACP;
  MCP prompts are commands.
- **Background jobs hold their task tree.** While a job runs, no other worker claims a task of
  its tree (`Store.hold` / `unhold`, a `holds` table, `ToolContext.hold`), so the next turn can
  read and stop it with several workers on one store; a job whose worker is gone is reported
  lost to the model. Third-party stores implement `hold` and `unhold`.
- **Plugins as files.** `~/.noeta/plugins/*.py` (or a directory) is a plugin without packaging;
  a project's `.noeta/plugins/` loads once trusted (`noeta trust`). `noeta plugins` lists where
  each plugin comes from.
- **Any plugin can ask the person and notify them.** `noeta.ask` / `noeta.read_answer`
  (`noeta.core.questions`, moved from `ask_user`) and `notify` on `TaskView` / `ToolContext`;
  front ends import no plugin. `Mcp` takes servers in Claude Code's `mcpServers` shape.
