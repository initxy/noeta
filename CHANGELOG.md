## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - YYYY-MM-DD

Initial preview release.

### Added

- Three-distribution layout: `noeta-runtime` (engine + agent materials),
  `noeta-sdk` (thin in-process client surface), and `noeta-agent` (the official
  coding-agent app shell with HTTP/SSE backend and bundled web app).
- Event-sourced engine: every step lands in an append-only EventLog, the single
  source of truth a task's state is folded from.
- Offline `stub` provider — a deterministic two-turn LLM double that needs no API
  key and no network, for proving install + storage + Engine wiring on a fresh
  checkout.
- Single-host, single-worker durable execution with exactly-once wake recovery.
